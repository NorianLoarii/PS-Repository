    "In this program we were asked to calculate the sample mean, the mode and the standard deviation, but with one variant, the user chose what would he want to calculate, and also it is meant to be in an infinite loop, so in this program we asked first to the user what would he want to calculate, with options a, b or c, then it will verify if it was a valid option or not, if it is true then it will change the e value to 0 so it can calculate the sample mean at the end of the while loop, if it's false then it will end the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we opened a while loop with the condition of i==0 meaning it will stop until i gets a different value other than 0, after starting with the while we placed an input of the data that accepts also text in order to it be possible to stop the programthen we opened an if condition to verify if the number of values is more than 1 and if the inputed string is stop, it is 1 as it starts the counting in 0, that 1 is treated in fact as a 2. It changes the value of e to 1 and the d to \"d\" so after stopping the loop it won't do anything after it. The other condition is to only verify if m is equal to stop, this is for the purpose of stopping it if we have 2 or more data in order to not take the other condition, which depends of the number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decided to introduce a value to the program then it will engage the other option which is the one that accepts all values that are not equal to stop, then it will convert the value to a floating number so we could work with formulas, as we are going to need sumatories, we calculated a sumatory of the data and put all the data in an array called l, and it sums up one number to the n variable as it is treated as the number of values introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "After those instructions if the loop is stopped, then it will evaluate the condition of e, if it's 0 then it will calculate the mean, by dividing the sumatory we done in the while loop by the number of values the user introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user wrote an \"a\" at the time he was asked to chose, then the program will show the sample mean and end.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user wrote a \"b\", then it will evaluate each number of the list, and replace the variable that will be shown with the current highest times a number repeats itself, also it verifies if there are multi-modal cases as they will be added in the \"modas\" array if the highest times a number repeats happens again. Therefore at the end of evaluating, it will determine if the list is a case of one mode, a multi-modal or a non-modal case.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, if the user wrote a \"c\", then the program will calculate how much is each value minus the sample mean, and all that squared, after that it will sum it in order to have the upper part of the process of calculating the variance, after finishing calculating the upper part, then it will be divided by the number of data minus one as the formula indicates, and in order to get the standard deviation we just elevated the variance to the 1/2 to get the square root and the standard deviation, and it will print this result."
