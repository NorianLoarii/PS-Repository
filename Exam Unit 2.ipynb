    "In this program I made a code with an infinite loop using a while 5, as the condition is always proven true it will never stop as it is independant from any other variables, then I placed an input for every time we introduce Time and Temperature respectively, then I separated every sumatory into simplier variables as it will sum them every time the loop repeats itself, after that I placed an m that is only the time of n added by one every time it repeats itself, then an if condition was placed only to verify if its the second time we introduce a pair of values, after that in the if it calculates the formula and at the same time calculates how many time will it take to reach to 35C, at the end it only sums 1 more to the value of n"
